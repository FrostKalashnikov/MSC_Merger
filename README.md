This is the MSC Screen & Camera Recorder Plugin Merger file from the marketplace: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/5dd54d3aeb804fa593f52a8de1d03767

In case of failure to download automatically by the plugin, these are the steps to follow to manually download and apply the plugin.

Instructions for manual installation:

1- download Merger according to the installed plugin version (versions separated by branches) the correct version can be seen in the plugins tab where it appears.

2- with Merger downloaded, you will place it in the directory: [UE_Version]/Engine/Plugins/Marketplace/MSC_Record/AppMerger/

3- in the same Merger folder, you will create a file called "MergerVersion.txt" and inside that file put the Merger Baixada version number, example: "1.2"

Enjoy. ;)
